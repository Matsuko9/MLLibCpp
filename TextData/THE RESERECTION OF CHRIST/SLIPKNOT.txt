Lost in the pessimistic, state of perception
It's been, hard to participate in, natural instances
And, due to my history, I, don't know what's next for me
But, keep my composure, fuck over anyone next to me
If, dean detriment told me love was for negligent
Motherfuckers that can't seem to keep wearin' their head
I'm not self-aware, I'm misled, I'm a hypocrite like the rest
I will kill myself if it benefit all of my fucking friends
I'm sorry mama, I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I could test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt, I swear to God, you'll be my first
Priority before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse
I said, I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I had to test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt, I swear to God, you'll be my first
Priority before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse
