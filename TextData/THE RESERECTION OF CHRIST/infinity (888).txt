Murder these flows like I murder these hoe ass niggas
Where the fuck is your energy, bro?
Make your nigga deepthroat a Desert Eagle
If he try me like a hoe, pussy boy, that's on my soul
Make my flow shapeshift, cold expression like a facelift
At the publix with like eight grips if you talkin' all that ape shit
I'm not talkin' YMBAPE shit, but I'm bangin' on my chest, bitch
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Travelin' through the infinity, uh
You not that nigga, pretend to be, uh
All that bullshit do not get to me, uh
I am a spirit, an entity, uh
You just wan suck up my energy, uh
I am the realest since Kennedy, uh
You pussy ass niggas fuckin' suck, you sound the same
I spit the pain, that's why these young niggas feel the same
They know I bang, I'll pull a fuckin' pistol out the Range and act insane

I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
So I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I spent years at the crib, so I don't feel the pain no more
I don't feel the pain no more
I gotta get it how I live, so I don't feel the pain no more (yeah)
I don't feel the pain (ay) no more (ay)
