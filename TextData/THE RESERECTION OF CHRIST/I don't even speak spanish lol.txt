Sway you like a lullaby-y-y-y-y
Dance with me through the ni-i-i-i-ight
Back to mi casa, baby, sli-i-i-i-ide
Let me make you feel alri-i-i-i-ight
Girl, I'll have you feeling ri-i-i-i-ight
Maybe only for a ni-i-i-i-ight
Come with me and feel the vi-i-i-i-ibe
Know I wanna get insi-i-i-i-ide

Hold it now, the way you spin around
Got me so aroused, I can't keep it down
Hold it now the way you spin around
Got me so aroused, I can't keep it down
